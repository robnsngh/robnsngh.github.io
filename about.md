About me ?

So my grandmother (imagine Golda Meir who dosnt understand hebrew and the only woman I love) thinks that I am just an average cook who should start behaving like a grown up.

I personally think I am someone who is infinitely curious about pretty much every thing.
I like building things so I went to University of Michigan and I trained as a Mechanical Engineer. They turned me into the perfect concoction of someone who can do a bunch of really cool things. Now I code, dabble with electronics and design stuff.

I love a lot of things, so I would use this website to document a few of them.

I like communicating through heart but the world makes me use my brain instead.
All my posts are my personal opinion and do not represent my employer.

Thanks for reading!
