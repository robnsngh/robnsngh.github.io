##THIS IS OLD POST IMPORTED FROM MY WORDPRESS BLOG !

I am really excited about the new Kinect V2 camera. Kinect was launched back in 2010 when it was one of its kind. I remember the other accessible 3D camera back in the day was a SwissRanger for which you would put down $9k.

With the launch of KinectV2, Microsoft is bringing out the TOF (Time of Flight) where the depth map can capture a much larger area with higher accuracy. Together the sensor array is spitting out 2 gigabit (not byte as popular belief). A good portion of data is downsampled within the hardware.

The old Kinect was supported with OpenNI. Unfortunately, Primesense was taken over by Apple inc so they brought down the development process (wtf bro!).

I will be working with the KinectV2 where I am planning to implement 3D point cloud detection for Face Recognition
