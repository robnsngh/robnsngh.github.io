## Until Now

Without a speck of doubt, I have had a scintillating experience completing my four years
of undergraudate studies. I commemorated my studies this year in May. Oh and trust me it has been hell of a ride.

After graduating form college, I was fanatically applying for jobs. I studied mechanical engineering and after graduating all I wanted to do was to program computers. Thankfully this little magical place called Silicon Valley was kind enough to offer me positions irrespective of my degree.

I got gracious offers from leading software and robotics companies in the valley. Thats when I decided to make a decision. I decided to work for $0/hr. I decided to do something of my own.
